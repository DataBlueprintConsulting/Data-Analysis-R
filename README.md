# 📊 Data Analysis Using R

This repository contains R code for performing comprehensive data analysis. The analysis covers a wide range of statistical techniques and visualizations to explore, summarize, and infer insights from data. Below is an overview of the methodologies and statistical concepts used in this project.

---

## 📂 Features and Techniques

### 🔄 Bootstrapping
- Resampling techniques to estimate the variability of sample statistics.
- Applications in confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.

### 📊 Visualizations
- Graphical representations for better data understanding:
  - Histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, and line graphs.
  - Enhanced visuals using libraries like `ggplot2`.

### 📈 Descriptive Statistics
- **Average**: Mean and median calculation to summarize data.
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures data dispersion from the mean.
- **Variance**: Quantifies the spread of data points.

### 📜 Information Theory
- **Entropy**: Calculates the level of disorder or uncertainty in a dataset.

### 📐 Estimation Techniques
- Point and interval estimation for population parameters.
- Applications in decision-making and risk assessment.

### 📊 Covariance and Correlation
- **Covariance**: Measure of the directional relationship between variables.
- **Correlation**: Strength and direction of a linear relationship.

### 📊 Probability Distributions
- **Normal Distribution**: Analysis and visualization of normally distributed data.
- **Null Distribution**: Basis for hypothesis testing.

### 📉 Hypothesis Testing
- Tests for statistical significance:
  - **Risk Ratio**: Quantifies the relative risk of an event.
  - **Difference in Means**: Evaluates if two sample means differ significantly.
  - **Difference Ratio**: Compares relative differences between variables.

### 🧪 Statistical Significance
- **p-Value**: Determines the statistical significance of results.
- Critical for validating hypotheses and conclusions.

### 📊 Regression Analysis
- Linear regression models:
  - **Alpha/Beta Coefficients**: Estimation of intercept and slope for predictors.
- Applications in predictive modeling and trend analysis.
